This code is developed by Zain Abubaker under the supervision of Dr. Nadeem Javaid.
The details for the implementation of the problem discussed in my Paper 
"Blockchained Service Provisioning and Malicious Node Detection via Federated Learning in Scalable Internet of Sensor Things Networks" 
is performed using MATLAB, Python and Solidity. 
Furthermore, for further assistance please e-mail at "Zainmalik.gcuf@gmail.com".

1. The code with the name "Novel.m" refers to the deployment of nodes in the field and trust evaluation of beacon nodes.
2. The code with sol extension refers to the implementation of non-repudiation in the network in Solidity.
3. The code in the folder (SVM and RF) refers to the implementation of MATLAB code for malicious nodes detection by support vector machine and random forest.
4. The code with py extension refers to the implementation of the "ECCAES" cryptographic technique and it is integrated with Solidity code to achieve non-repudiation in the network.
